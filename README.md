## About

This is a Microsoft Teams clone built with React JS and Chat Engine!

I have been using MS Teams for my college purposes and so I decided to try making something similar to it.
Some features include
 * Online statuses
 * fuild design and functionality
 * icons telling you who read the message
 * image support
 * sound notifications
 * the ability to create multiple rooms
 
React JS is the framework used and Chat Engine is a set of APIs and UI Kit specific to chat. The application has been deployed using netlify.
